TRAVIS ("TRajectory Analyzer and VISualizer") is a program package 
for analyzing and visualizing Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics trajectories. 
TRAVIS is open-source freeware and licensed under the terms of the 
GNU General Public License v3 (see file COPYING).

 * Installation *

To compile TRAVIS, open the Makefile and set the CXX variable
to the C++ compiler of your choice. Then just enter "make". If everything
worked, an executable ("travis") should appear in the "exe" directory.

TRAVIS does not require any external libraries.

When compiling TRAVIS on systems that are not running Linux, you may have to
edit the "config.h" file in the "src" directory. Comment out the "TARGET_LINUX" line.
If you are building an Windows version, you may want to uncomment the "TARGET_WINDOWS" line.
With both lines commented out, you get a platform-independent build without
special features.
